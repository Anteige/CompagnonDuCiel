This program shows the coordinates of beginner level Messier objects visible around Montreal at the time it is executed. All you need to do is to compile and run !

Also, it shows the coordinates of a well known star in order to calibrate the right ascension on an EQ1.

The data used is from http://messier.obspm.fr/data1.html.
