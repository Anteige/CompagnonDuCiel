This program shows the coordinates of beginner level Messier objects visible around Montreal at the time it is executed. Also, it shows the coordinates of a known star in order to calibrate the right ascension on an EQ1.

All you need to do is to compile and run. Just make sure the executable is in the root directory.

The data used is from http://messier.obspm.fr/data1.html.
